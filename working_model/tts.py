    tts.save_audio_expert('''Logistic regression is a statistical method used for predicting the probability of a binary outcome (e.g., yes/no, true/false) based on one or more predictor variables. It is a powerful tool for classification tasks and is widely used in various fields, including healthcare, finance, and marketing.

**Key points to be discussed:**

* **The core concepts of logistic regression:** How it works, the underlying mathematical model, and the interpretation of the results.
* **Types of logistic regression:** Binary logistic regression (predicting a binary outcome) and multinomial logistic regression (predicting an outcome with multiple categories).
* **Applications of logistic regression:** Real-world examples of how logistic regression is used in various industries.
* **Advantages and limitations of logistic regression:** Understanding its strengths and weaknesses compared to other classification methods.
* **Building and evaluating a logistic regression model:** Practical steps involved in building, training, and evaluating a logistic regression model.''', "output_person1.mp3")
